# Egg Timer

## Our Goal

You will need to apply everything you have learnt before to complete this challenge. But most importantly, we want you to get comfortable with looking up how to do something you've never done before. Follow the 5 step process you learnt in the Xylophone module and use Google search, StackOverflow and Apple Documentation to make your code do what you want it to!

## What You'll Make

Youâ€™ll be building a beautiful egg timer app to boil your eggs to perfection depending on how you prefer your eggs.
